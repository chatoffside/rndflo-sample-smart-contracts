/*
The campaign registry is used to register RNDflo standard campaigns. It simply
registeres the campaign address and, if needed, an interface contract. A campaign
ID is then generated for that campaign. The registry, by design, is completely open.
All curation is done in the curation registry. The campaign _interface, is simply
a RNDflo standard interface contract. This is used for registering campaigns
that may not directly comply with the RNDflo standard campaign, but that want
to be registered on RNDflo.
